# Objective

## Background and project idea

Development of e-infrastructure in the humanities and arts have typically focused on enrichment available to domain experts in core areas such as literature, history, and media studies. Only recently we are starting to see infrastructural initiatives intended to support data-intensive research in digital humanities. These initiatives are, however, national and developed in parallel across the Nordics with limited knowledge sharing or cross-fertilization. To anticipate developments in national infrastructure and develop a pan-nordic platform for expert users (i.e., researchers with rich code repositories and technical research profiles), Nordic Digital Humanities Laboratory (NDHL) will design and implement a shared compute and data infrastructure that can facilitate code and data sharing for highly heterogeneous and unstructured cultural heritage data across the Nordics. NDHL is a digital humanities initiative in the Nordic countries with the goal of providing said infrastructure for expert users initially and, in time, for the rest of humanities and arts. This project plan describes the pre-study for NDHL.

> NDHL's goal is to provide a shared software and application layer for modeling and analysis of cultural heritage data across the Nordics. The NDHL prestudy will provide design patterns and build community required to initiate NDHL.


[comment]: # (@knielbo: we like to have the actual project idea tuned down to a one hiss pitch sentence, The NDHL pre-study contributes to ?community building and improved infrastructure design within more neglected parts within humanities? by ...)


## Project objective
[comment]: # (Summarise the result that should be achieved at a certain time, and
for which cost. Describe also the balance in the project objective between the
result/time/cost dimensions. The basis for this should be found in the project directive)

For the pre-study NDHL has three objectives (in decreasing order of importance):
*Infrastructure Design*,
*Community Building* and
*Funding Application(-s)*.


*Infrastructure Design*: By autumn 2020 partnering countries should agree on a minimal software stack with shared libraries and applications for Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden alongside documentation for execution, storage, and management layers for such a software stack in Denmark and Finland. This objective takes precedence over other objectives and all *Workshops* (see section 4) should explicitly state how they contribute to this objective. 0.55 of the budget and 0.75 of the workshops are directly dedicated to this objective.

*Community Building*: In order to facilitate successful infrastructure design and development it is necessary to build a stronger community among expert users and data- and e-infrastructure providers in the Nordic countries. In the pre-study, community building is considered as a direct product of *Hack days* and an indirect one of *Workshops* (see section 4). 0.075 of the budget is dedicated to *Hack days*, but if partners can commit time *Center for Humanities Computing Aarhus* will cover additional funding for this under its outreach program.

*Funding Application(-s)*: In order to develop and implement NDHL, the partnering countries (or a subset hereof) should formulate a generic research infrastructure application ultimo 2020. The final workshop in December 2020 is dedicated to this objective. If the partners decide not to move forward with the infrastructure, this objective is cancelled. The cancellation decision should be an outcome of the final workshop. 0.175 of the budget and 0.25 of the workshops are dedicated to this objective.


[comment]: # (table has ++dimensions, @Michaela: how do you want it populated? Answer: this is an example below, following our usual way, it should add up to 100 percent)

| Result | Time | Cost |
| -------|------|:----:|
| 0.5    | 0.3  | 0.2  |

## Expected Benefit

[comment]: # (@knielbo: This has to be made, clearer. You can copy and paste from the application, but try to tune it down to a list

## Limitations
[comment]: # (the project objective by describing what is not included in
the result, i.e. what other projects, the orderer or line functions are
responsible for, alternatively what will not be done at all.)

During the pre-study NDHL will not provide implementation of (or commit to implement) the virtual laboratory. This task will ultimately depend on a future collaboration between national e-infrastructure providers and universities. Nor will NDHL provide plug-n-play software tools for humanities research. Tools in or derived from the software library and applications layers have NDHL members as user group and are, therefore, likely to have minimnal documentation due to time constraints.
[comment]: # @knielbo Not sure whether I completely get this last sentence. Will potential early adopters be identified?

## Recipients and approval criteria
[comment]: # (Present the risks that have been identified during the preparation
phase. Present also the measures that will be taken. If the risk profile
is extensive, use the PPS template "Risk list".)

[comment]: # (Define for each delivery object who, or what organisation, will be the
recipient when the project delivers and transfers the result.)

[comment]: # (Describe also the approval criteria for the different delivery
objects. Use an appendix if needed.)

NDHL has three recipient classes: 1) project partners' research units, 2) infrastructure providers, 3) funding agencies. Approval criterium for 1 and 2 is commitment/no and for 3 is funding/no. Commitment from from at least two national partners is sufficient.

  | Delivery object | Recipient, delivery | Recipient, transferral |
  | --------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
  | Infrastructure design (paper) | 1, Autumn 2020 | 1 (Spring 2021) |
  | Early adopters and stakeholders (identification of) | xyz | xyz |
  | guidelines for documenation | 2, Autumn 2020  | xyz |

[comment]: # So who are the recipients?


# Project schedule and costs

## Milestones, decision points

[comment]: # (Describe key check points in the form of milestones and decision
points. When required, a Gantt chart can be attached as an appendix. Use
the PPS templates: "Project schedule" in PowerPoint - see" the Project
plan, presentation template" - and the "Schedule" in Excel.)

Milestones coincide with workshop deliverables. Defined milestones (MS) and decision points (DP):

  | Date | MS | DP | Description |
  | ---- | -- | -- | ----------- |
  | Dec 18-19, 2109 | WS 1 | Requirements | Planning content of shared stack |
  | Jan 15, 2020  | Requirements | . | Finalize WS 1 output |
  | May 01, 2020  | WS 2 | Abstract description | Stakeholders meeting in order to finalize abstract description of NDHL |

# Organisation
[comment]: # (Describe the project organisation, roles in the project and the names
of those appointed.)


| Role | Name |
| --- | --- |
| Steering group | NA (pre-studies are handled very light-weight) |
| Pre-study owner representative | Michaela Barth |
| Project manager | Kristoffer L. Nielbo |
| Working group | Eetu Makela, Lars Borin, Lars Johnson, Kristoffer L. Nielbo |

# Working methods
NDHL adhere to principles for Open-Source Software (OSS) and publish software under the MIT license. For data, NDHL follows the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) for management of metadata and, when possible raw and derived data.

[comment]: # (If possible, always refer to documented working methods in the
organisation. Describe only exceptions or additions to those methods,
and also working methods that are specific for this project.)

## Requirement dialogue and change control
[comment]: # (Describe how the stakeholders' expectations should be clarified, how
the requirement dialogue and the work involved in establishing support
will be carried out, and also how the project handles changes to the
requirements. Who decides what.)

Stakeholder expectations and requirements are clarified in WS 1 and 2, where each stakeholder group will to present their current solution as well as nice- & need-to-haves for NDHL. Changes to requirements are then discussed and subsequently tested by the national coordinators' research groups.


## Delivery and transferral

[comment]: # (Describe the procedure for delivery and approval, and also for
transferral and approval. Appendices can be used for complex deliveries,
in order to clarify details regarding packaging, delivery procedure and
approval criteria, e.g. requirement and solutions descriptions.)

## Monitoring and learning
[comment]: # (Describe how monitoring will be carried out, at what intervals, and
the forums that will be used. Describe the activities that the project
has planned for continuous learning and lessons learnt, and also how
this knowledge will be passed on to others.)


Monitoring is carried out between NeIC and NDHL during bi-monthly management meetings and internally (in NDHL) national coordinators meet once a month on Slack (first Thursday in the month, 0900-1100). Activities are documented in GitHub repositories and through the web [website](addS_url.com).

## Information distribution
[comment]: # (Describe how the project information will be spread both internally
and externally.)
* NDHL maillists (coordinator list and stakeholder list)
* Slack for coordinators


# Risks
[comment]: # (Present the risks that have been identified during the preparation
phase. Present also the measures that will be taken. If the risk profile
is extensive, use the PPS template "Risk list")



[comment]: # (We use the scale 1-3, 1: low, 2: medium, 3: high . and for overall risk we multiply the numbers for the probability and impact to form an overall risk.)

## Detailed program ##

### National *State of the Art* ###
National coordinators (Lars Borin, Lars Johnsen, Eetu M&auml;kel&auml;, Kristoffer L. Nielbo) and data providers (Lars Johnsen, Love B&ouml;rjeson, Per Møldrup-Dalum) present a summary of what is available to them in terms of compute and data at a national level. Please prepare a couple of succinct slides for documentation of summaries. The goal is to identify current national infrastructures that NDHL can leverage. 

### NDHL Wishlist ###
Each participant presents a short wishlist of what in terms of compute and data would facilitate computational research/digital humanities across the Nordics. The goal is to define minimal requirements to NDHL.

### Pilot Infrastructure ###
How do we communicate and share knowledge during the NDHL pilot study? We currently have a [website](https://centre-for-humanities-computing.github.io/Nordic-Digital-Humanities-Laboratory/) in need of content, a Slack channel under NeIC, and a GitHUb [repository](https://github.com/centre-for-humanities-computing/ndhl.neic). Is this sufficient and how do we maximize their utility. At the moment cooridnators are available on Slack first Thursday each month 09:00-11:00.

### NDHL 2020 Activvites ###
Planned activities for 2020 are outlined in the [project plan](https://github.com/centre-for-humanities-computing/ndhl.neic/blob/master/project_plan/ndhl_projectplan.md), but we need to update and approve activities collectively.
